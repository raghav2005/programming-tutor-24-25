## Git + Terminal

### Git Setup

Replace `<github_username>` and `<github_email>` with yours below:

```sh
git config --global user.name "<github_username>"
git config --global user.email "<github_email>"
```

### Git

#### Creating a new repo

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click on the green `New` button to create a new repository.

2. Name the repo and set the privacy to public/private as needed.

3. Select yes for the option to automatically create the `README` file.

4. Make sure to add the relevant `gitignore` for your project e.g. search for `Python` if it's a Python project.
   - After setting up the repo, refer to [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/) to automatically create a larger gitignore with more coverage for different OSes, IDEs, or Programming Languages.

5. Create the project, the repository, then click on the green `Code` button and copy the link displayed.
   - Make sure you are in the `Local` and `HTTPS` tabs after clicking the button.

6. Go to your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want the project folder to be (using `cd` and `ls`), and type `git clone <repo_link>`, replacing `<repo_link>` with the link you copied.

7. `cd` into the project folder, and **congratulations! you have created a git repo and cloned it locally to work on it!**
