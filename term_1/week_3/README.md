- [Sketches](#sketches)

## Leetcode

We first went through the solutions for last week's leetcodes. Refer to [Week 2's README file](../week_2/README.md) to find the solution files.

Next week, we will go through the solutions for the following leetcodes:

- [Reverse Words in a String (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string)
  - [Python Solution](leetcode_sols/leetcode_1_sol.py)
- [Product of Array Except Self (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self)
  - [Python Solution](leetcode_sols/leetcode_2_sol.py)

## C

We covered the following things in this week's session:

- recap of pointers
- arrays + arrays of strings
- static vs dynamic memory allocation
  - stack vs heap
  - malloc vs calloc vs memset
- the 3 uses of stacks in computer science (stack data structure, stack memory, stack frames)

## Python (OOP)

- what are classes?
- inheritance
- overriding
- self and super
- private (\_\_), protected (\_), & public
- \_\_init\_\_, \_\_str\_\_.
- instance variables, class variables

## Sketches

For the diagrams drawn during the session, refer to [this pdf](sketches.pdf).
